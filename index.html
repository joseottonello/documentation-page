           <header id="Introduction"> Introduction</header>
            <p>In this Responsive Web Design Certification, I learned about the main languages that developers use to create web pages: HTML (hypertext markup language) for content and CSS (cascading style sheets) for design, these two elements are indispensable For any web page, every web page that we see, has been created with these two tools. This document is my memory aid and also my personal guide after having completed the certification.</p>

          <section class="main-section"> <header id="HTML"> HTML y HTML5 basics</header>
            <p>HTML is a markup language that uses a special syntax or notation to describe the structure of a web page to the browser. HTML elements often have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to the content. For example, different elements can describe the text such as a heading, paragraph, list item, and more. As a convention, all HTML tags are written in lowercase. Some examples of HTML tags:
            </p>
            <code>h4 Hello world /h4 (title)
                p This is my Proyect /p (paragraph)
                ul (list)
                li milk /li
                li cheese /li 
                /ul
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section"> 
            <header id="CSS"> CSS basic</header>
            <p>CSS, or cascading style sheets, tells the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML. With CSS, you can control the color, font, size, spacing, and many other aspects of HTML elements. Example in CSS:
            </p>
            <code>style
                h2 {
                color: red;
                }
                /style
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section">
           <header id="VDA"> Visual design Applied</header>
            <p>Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help convey your unique message. In this course, you will learn how to apply these different visual design elements to your web pages. Example in Visual Design Applied:
            </p>
            <code>
               img {
               width: 220px;
               }
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section">
           <header id="AA">Applied accessibility</header>
            <p>In web development, accessibility refers to web content and a UI (user interface) that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a wide audience. This includes people with visual, hearing, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. In this course, you will learn the best practices for creating accessible web pages for everyone. Example:
            </p>
            <code>
               audio id="meowClip" controls
               source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"
               source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg"
               /audio
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section">
           <header id="RWDP">Responsive web design principles</header>
            <p>There are many devices that can access the web and they come in all shapes and sizes. Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions. In this part, I used CSS to make your web pages look good, no matter what device they are viewed on. One example:
            </p>
            <code>
                @media (max-width: 100px) { /* CSS Rules */ }
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section">
           <header id="Flexbox">CSS Flexbox</header>
            <p>Flexbox is a powerful and well supported layout method that was introduced with the latest version of CSS, CSS3. With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically. Here, i will learn the fundamentals of flexbox and dynamic designs when creating a Twitter card. Example:
            </p>
            <code>
                #box-container {
                height: 500px;
                display: flex;
                }
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section">
           <header id="Grid">CSS Grid</header>
            <p>The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to create complex, responsive layouts. It works by converting an HTML element to a grid and allows you to place child elements anywhere within. In this part, I will learn the fundamentals of the CSS grid by creating different complex layouts, including a blog. One example:
            </p>
            <code>
               .container {
               display: grid;
               }
            </code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section"><header id="Proyects">Proyects</header>
            <p>Once the activities were finished, I carried out a series of projects (which can be seen in my portfolio) with which I finished the "Responsive WEB Design" certification. These helped me develop and relax to be ready in the event of a job proposal.
